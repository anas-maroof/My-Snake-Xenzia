# My-Snake-Xenzia

Certainly, here's a description and README for your Snake game project:

**Project Description:**

This project is a classic Snake game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to control the snake, allowing it to eat food that appears randomly on the field. Each time the snake consumes food, the player's score increases. The game also features an adjustable speed setting, a high-score tracker, and challenging obstacles â€“ if the snake bumps into walls or collides with its own body, it's game over. Whether you're looking for a nostalgic gaming experience or a fun challenge, this project offers a delightful way to test your reflexes and strategic thinking.
